React Modular Architecture Rules
This document contains rules and guidelines for building modular React applications using established UI patterns and architectural principles. These rules are designed to create maintainable, scalable, and testable React applications.

Core Principles

1. React is a View Library, Not a Framework
   RULE: Treat React as a library for building user interfaces only
   RULE: Do not mix business logic, data fetching, or state management directly in React components
   RULE: Consider your application as a JavaScript/TypeScript application that happens to use React for views
2. Separation of Concerns
   RULE: Always separate view logic from non-view logic
   RULE: Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility
   RULE: Avoid mixing different levels of abstraction in the same file or component
   Component Design Rules
3. Component Responsibility
   RULE: Each component should focus on one thing only
   RULE: If a component is handling multiple concerns, split it into smaller components
   RULE: Components should be as pure as possible - given the same input, they produce the same output
4. Pure Components
   RULE: Prefer pure functional components over stateful components
   RULE: Extract state management into custom hooks
   RULE: Keep components focused on rendering UI only
5. Component Size
   RULE: If a component requires significant scrolling to read, it's too large
   RULE: Extract sub-components when you see repeated patterns or logical groupings
   RULE: Smaller components are more likely to be reusable
   State Management Rules
6. Custom Hooks for State
   RULE: Use custom hooks to encapsulate state management logic
   RULE: Hooks should return both state and functions to modify that state
   RULE: Name custom hooks with the use prefix (e.g., usePaymentMethods)
7. State Location
   RULE: Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
   RULE: Lift state up only when necessary for sharing between components
   RULE: Consider hooks as state machines that components can connect to
   Data Modeling Rules
8. Domain Objects
   RULE: Create domain classes/objects to encapsulate business logic
   RULE: Domain objects should not contain any UI-related information
   RULE: Use domain objects to avoid logic leakage in views
9. Data Conversion
   RULE: Handle data transformation in dedicated functions or classes
   RULE: Keep data conversion logic out of components
   RULE: Create a clear boundary between remote data formats and local domain objects
   Architecture Patterns
10. Layered Architecture
    RULE: Organize code into distinct layers: View, Model, and Data
    RULE: Each layer should only communicate with adjacent layers
    RULE: Dependencies should flow in one direction (typically View → Model → Data)
11. Anti-Corruption Layer
    RULE: Create gateway objects to encapsulate external system access
    RULE: Isolate API changes to a single location
    RULE: Convert external data formats to internal domain objects at the boundary
12. Polymorphism Over Conditionals
    RULE: Replace scattered if-else checks with polymorphic objects
    RULE: Use strategy pattern for country/locale-specific logic
    RULE: Avoid "shotgun surgery" by centralizing variant behavior
    Code Organization Rules
13. File Structure
    src/
    ├── components/ # Pure UI components
    ├── hooks/ # Custom React hooks
    ├── models/ # Domain objects and business logic
    ├── services/ # API clients and external integrations
    ├── utils/ # Helper functions
    └── types/ # TypeScript type definitions
14. Module Boundaries
    RULE: Each module should have clear inputs and outputs
    RULE: Avoid circular dependencies between modules
    RULE: Domain logic should never depend on UI logic
15. Naming Conventions
    RULE: Use descriptive names that indicate the module's responsibility
    RULE: Suffix view-related files with their type (e.g., Payment.tsx for components)
    RULE: Use consistent naming patterns across the codebase
    Testing and Reusability
16. Testability
    RULE: Pure components are easier to test - prefer them
    RULE: Domain objects should be fully testable without UI
    RULE: Hooks can be tested independently of components
17. Reusability Checklist
    RULE: Before creating a component, ask: "Could this be used elsewhere?"
    RULE: Extract common patterns into shared components
    RULE: Domain logic should be reusable across different UI frameworks
    Refactoring Guidelines
18. Progressive Enhancement
    RULE: Start simple and refactor as complexity grows
    RULE: Don't over-engineer from the beginning
    RULE: Apply patterns when they solve actual problems
19. Refactoring Triggers
    RULE: When adding a feature requires changes in multiple places → Extract shared logic
    RULE: When a component becomes hard to understand → Split it
    RULE: When you see repeated if-else for variants → Consider polymorphism
20. Code Smells to Avoid
    RULE: Avoid "shotgun surgery" - needing to change multiple files for one feature
    RULE: Avoid logic leakage - business rules scattered in views
    RULE: Avoid mixed concerns - components doing too many things
    Implementation Examples
21. Hook Pattern
    // GOOD: Extracted hook with clear responsibility
    const useRoundUp = (amount: number, strategy: PaymentStrategy) => {
    const [agreeToDonate, setAgreeToDonate] = useState(false);

const { total, tip } = useMemo(() => ({
total: agreeToDonate ? strategy.getRoundUpAmount(amount) : amount,
tip: strategy.getTip(amount),
}), [agreeToDonate, amount, strategy]);

return { total, tip, agreeToDonate, updateAgreeToDonate };
}; 22. Pure Component Pattern
// GOOD: Pure component focused on rendering
const PaymentMethods = ({ options }: { options: PaymentMethod[] }) => (
<>
{options.map((method) => (
<label key={method.provider}>
<input
          type="radio"
          name="payment"
          value={method.provider}
          defaultChecked={method.isDefaultMethod}
        />
<span>{method.label}</span>
</label>
))}
</>
); 23. Domain Object Pattern
// GOOD: Domain object encapsulating business logic
class PaymentMethod {
constructor(private remotePaymentMethod: RemotePaymentMethod) {}

get provider() {
return this.remotePaymentMethod.name;
}

get label() {
if (this.provider === 'cash') {
return `Pay in ${this.provider}`;
}
return `Pay with ${this.provider}`;
}

get isDefaultMethod() {
return this.provider === "cash";
}
} 24. Strategy Pattern
// GOOD: Strategy pattern for handling variants
class CountryPayment {
constructor(
private currencySign: string,
private algorithm: RoundUpStrategy
) {}

getRoundUpAmount(amount: number): number {
return this.algorithm(amount);
}

getTip(amount: number): number {
return calculateTipFor(this.getRoundUpAmount.bind(this))(amount);
}
}
Best Practices Summary 25. Development Workflow
Start with a simple component
Extract hooks when state logic becomes complex
Create domain objects when business rules emerge
Split components when they handle multiple concerns
Introduce patterns when they solve real problems 26. Decision Framework
Can this logic be used without React? → Extract to domain object
Is this about managing state? → Extract to custom hook
Is this about rendering UI? → Keep in component
Is this about external systems? → Create a service/gateway 27. Quality Checklist
Components are focused and easy to understand
Business logic is testable without UI
Changes are localized to relevant modules
Code can be reused in different contexts
Dependencies flow in one direction
Anti-Patterns to Avoid 28. Common Mistakes
AVOID: Fetching data directly in components
AVOID: Transforming data in render methods
AVOID: Scattered conditional logic for variants
AVOID: Mixing UI and business logic
AVOID: Creating unnecessary temporary files or scripts 29. Code Review Red Flags
Components over 200 lines
Multiple useEffect hooks in one component
Business logic in event handlers
Repeated if-else checks across files
Direct API calls in components
Migration Strategy 30. Incremental Refactoring
Identify the busiest components first
Extract custom hooks for state management
Create domain objects for business logic
Introduce service layers for external calls
Apply patterns gradually as needed
Remember: The goal is to create a maintainable, scalable application where each part has a clear responsibility and can be understood, tested, and modified independently.
